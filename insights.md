## Key Findings
1. Checkout has the highest rage-click rate, indicating high frustration even with lower traffic.
2. Signup shows elevated rage-click rate, suggesting unclear form validation or call-to-action behavior.
3. Pricing generates a high volume of rage clicks driven by traffic, likely from ambiguous plan selection.
4. Features shows lower rage-click activity, indicating relatively strong usability.

## Recommendations
- Add clearer feedback on checkout CTAs (loading state, disable double-click, more visible errors).
- Improve signup form UX (inline validation, clearer error copy, reduce friction).
- Clarify pricing plans (comparison cues, stronger visual hierarchy, clearer “best for” labels).
- Re-measure rage-click rate after changes to validate improvement.
